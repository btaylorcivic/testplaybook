# Playbook: Responding to Mass CrowdStrike Alerts

## 1. Purpose & Scope
**Purpose:**  
Rapid, standardized response for surges of CrowdStrike Falcon alerts indicating potential compromise or anomalous activity.

**Scope:**  
Any cluster of alerts (malware detections, suspicious authentication, lateral movement, etc.) affecting multiple hosts or accounts.

---

## 2. Trigger & Prerequisites

- **Triggers:**  
  - ≥ X alerts of the same type or tactic within Y minutes  
  - Alerts correlated by IP range, MITRE technique, or asset group

- **Prerequisites:**  
  - CrowdStrike → SIEM/SOAR integration  
  - Pre‑configured thresholds & playbook bindings  
  - Rostered SOC & IR teams on‑call  
  - Access to logging, identity, and network controls

## 4. Playbook Steps & Key Questions

### A. Incident Detection & Initial Assessment  
> *Establish timeline and initial understanding.*

- **When was the suspicious activity first detected and by whom?**  
- **How was the incident initially discovered?**  
  _(e.g., internal monitoring, customer report, external alert)_  
- **What was the exact date and time the first alert occurred?**  
- **How long did the attacker maintain access before detection/containment?**  
- **Was the initial scope accurate, or did it expand as more data arrived?**  
- **Is the alert flood still active, or has it been contained?**  

### B. Compromise Details & Attack Vector  
> *Determine how the threat actor got in and what they did.*

- **What vector is indicated by the alerts?**  
  _(e.g., phishing, brute‑force, credential stuffing, malware, exploit)_  
- **Was there evidence of credential‑based attacks (brute‑force or stuffing)?**  
- **Did the attacker exploit a known vulnerability or bypass controls?**  
- **Were protective measures (rate limiting, MFA) in place—and if so, were they circumvented?**  
- **What malicious actions did the attacker perform during access?**  
  _(e.g., data exfiltration, config changes, malware deployment)_  
- **Any signs of session hijacking, token misuse, or lateral movement?**  

### C. Scope of Compromise & Impact  
> *Quantify affected assets and potential damage.*

- **What is the full scope?**  
  _(single host, multiple hosts, user accounts, systems)_  
- **What data or services were accessed, modified, or exfiltrated?**  
- **Was sensitive or regulated data exposed?**  
- **Did the threat actor’s activity spread to other users or systems?**  
- **Evidence of lateral movement, privilege escalation, or role‑abuse?**  
- **Estimated financial, operational, and reputational impact?**  

### D. Security Controls & Monitoring Effectiveness  
> *Review existing defenses and detection.*

- **What authentication controls existed?**  
  _(MFA, password complexity, breach‑check, etc.)_  
- **Were passwords and tokens stored and rotated securely?**  
- **Did anomaly or behavioral monitoring trigger alerts?**  
- **Were any relevant alerts missed or improperly handled by SOC/tools?**  
- **Are logs comprehensive for all login attempts and system changes?**  
- **What session controls (IP binding, expiration, concurrency limits) were in place?**  
- **Automated alerts for suspicious IPs, TOR, or geolocation anomalies?**  

### E. Incident Response & Containment Actions  
> *Mitigate the threat and prevent further damage.*

- **When were affected hosts/accounts isolated or disabled?**  
- **Were all active sessions terminated immediately?**  
- **Was a forced password reset (and MFA enrollment) performed?**  
- **What steps removed persistence (backdoors, scheduled tasks)?**  
- **Was a forensic investigation launched?**  
- **Which IOCs (IPs, hashes) were blocked or quarantined?**  

### F. Communication & Notification  
> *Inform stakeholders and meet compliance.*

- **When and how were internal teams alerted?**  
- **Was the affected customer/user notified—and was communication clear and empathetic?**  
- **Which regulatory bodies (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, PCI DSS) need notification?**  
- **What’s the internal update cadence and format (SITREPs, dashboards)?**  
- **Are public statements or press releases required?**  

### G. Root Cause Analysis  
> *Identify why it happened to prevent recurrence.*

- **Did credential reuse or breach‑database matches factor in?**  
- **Was the root cause a platform vuln, misconfiguration, or external factor?**  
- **If MFA was optional, why was it not enabled?**  
- **Any policy/process failures or human errors identified?**  

### H. Remediation & Future Prevention  
> *Long‑term fixes and proactive defenses.*

- **Has MFA been enforced for all users, especially privileged?**  
- **Are login anomaly and behavioral detections reviewed and tuned?**  
- **Have users been educated on phishing, password hygiene, MFA importance?**  
- **Are alerts in place for new or failed login attempts?**  
- **Is there self‑service visibility into account activity for users?**  
- **Have all technical and process vulnerabilities been addressed?**  
- **What continuous monitoring and training programs are running?**  

### I. Policy, Governance & Compliance  
> *Ensure organizational readiness and alignment.*

- **Is the IR plan updated for mass‑alert scenarios?**  
- **Is there a formal notification plan for users, stakeholders, regulators?**  
- **Are data retention policies sufficient for logs and forensic needs?**  
- **Have authentication and recovery policies been reviewed post‑incident?**  
- **Is a third‑party audit, pentest, or red‑team exercise scheduled?**  
- **Are regular risk assessments conducted for ATO and related vectors?**
